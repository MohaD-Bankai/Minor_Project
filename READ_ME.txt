The ZIP file consists of five folders, one report file in .doc format, and one README text file. Each folder contains one raw dataset, one .ipynb file, and one report file in .doc format. We have completed five projects and created five different reports, each housed within its respective folder. The Master report encapsulates the conclusions from all individual reports. To gain a comprehensive understanding, please review the contents of each folder.
